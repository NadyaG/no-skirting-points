# Basic structure

**NoPoints** is a testing project for GitHub pages as documentation website. No actual software is available or offered under the name.

Providing several guides for slightly different audiences and purposes is typical for a software documentation project. It should be well structured to let the users find the document appropriate for them at a glance.
